title: Privacy Policy
description: What we do with your information.
---

To maintain the security and privacy of our users, Sentinel ("Us", “We”, Our", "Sentinel") has a privacy policy which affords rights to our users ("You", “Your”, “User”, “Users”) in regards to their data.

By accepting these Policies, you also agree that you understand them fully in their entirety, and that you have not concluded any ambiguity in our ToS.

## Discord Authorization

When logging in with Discord, we use their provided OAuth2 technology, therefore we don't have to collect any of your sensitive information.
When using Discord's OAuth we will request for 2 scopes which are "guilds" and "identify".
We'll store your authentication information as follows:
- **User ID**, **Username**, **Avatar** (`JWT`)
- **Hashed IP-Address**, **Browser Fingerprint**, **Hashed Discord ID** (`JWT`)

The information above is only stored whilst you are authenticated and is used for identifying you and security purposes which are required by default to prevent attacks and possible flooding of information to our service.

## Sentinel Verification

Our verification system does not require much data to understand what purpose a user has in the given community.
When attempting to verify, the information we have is as follows:
- **Community origin ID**, Discord **User ID** and **Username** which is stored temporarily in memory and quickly deleted as we have no use for this information and would inflate our service.
- **Hashed IP-Address** for reputation thread monitoring to understand if it's malicious.

The information above such as network analyst is stored indefinitely but not displayed publicly in our blockchain technology which is used to identify users in the same blockchain using the same network and possibly prevent threats.

## Sharing Information

At absolutely no point will we ever share any data we have about you unless you are the subject of a law enforcement request that we havef deemed legitmate and lawful.
We do not sell your data and we do not share your data with any non-law enforcement entities.
With the exception of case invovling a threat to life, all legal requests for information must utilize a signed subpoena/court order that compels us to turn over information on our users.
